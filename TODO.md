## Accepts optimization function for different optimizer choices

##  Random effects on some parameters in kalman filters

## Prediction function without data update
This should be for both moment diff eqs and simulation (stochastic!)

## Use NumDeriv if analytic hessian fails to retrieve std. error

## Free optimizer choice, but nlminb as standard
1. We need to be able to set `nlminb` settings in the `estimate` function.

## plot function for returned object from `predict`

# add_parameters
doesnt remove a fixed parameter when recalling add_parameters without NA's.
We need to update this

# Maybe just compile 1 single cpp function for all methods?
